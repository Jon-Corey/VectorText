# Vector Text

Vector Text is a tool for converting text to an SVG path. This is useful since using fonts directly in an SVG can be problematic, especially when it comes to compatibility.

Most tools either don't support fonts at all or just don't support external fonts. This means that the text in your SVG can look great in your editor or in some places, but have the wrong font in other places.

What Vector Text does is take the text and font selection and converts that text into an SVG path, which works the same everywhere.
