# Vector Text

Vector Text is a tool for converting text to an SVG path. This is useful since using fonts directly in an SVG can be problematic, especially when it comes to compatibility.

Most tools either don't support fonts at all or just don't support external fonts. This means the text in your SVG can look great in your editor or in some places, but have the wrong font in other places.

What Vector Text does is take the text and font selection and converts that text into an SVG path, which works the same everywhere.

You can check out Vector Text at [vector-text.com](https://vector-text.com).

### Running Locally

This site is a simple static site with HTML, CSS, and JS. There is no additional tooling needed or any build process. I suggest using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code to run a simple web server for testing.
